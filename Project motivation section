roject Motivation: (3 marks)
1. Describe what motivated your group to choose this particular project? And how does it relate to your individual and collective interests?

As University students we were all stuck with the same problem of having troubles knowing when set work activities were due and just in general finding where meetings, schedules, classes and school events were happening. Sometimes
 its because we are lazy, sometimes we are too busy with work or our lives outside of university, sometimes we are just forgetful. Hence to alleviate such issues our group members were all individually thinking of ways and ideas of effectively organising oneâ€™s university life so they can more effeciently enjoy their social life. Hence, coming together we decided to come up with a project idea of incorporating many different features and functionality to ultimately enable users to keep track of and keep on top their university life with the help of a single mobile application.
