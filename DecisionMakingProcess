Decision Making Process
1. Idea is proposed
2. A team vote is held via Trello card at least 24 hours later to give everybody a chance to think it through.
3. Majority accepted
4. Decision recorded on the card, and actioned by relevant individuals.

Dispute Resolution
1. All concerned parties will have their voices heard at our next meeting.
2. If the decision cannot be talked through as a team, a coin is flipped to make the decision.
3. If a coin is unable to be used (more than two options), we will use a randomizing app that allows more than two options.
