Justified Workloads
All our tasks each week are setup as individual cards on Trello. Each card is allocated to a person, and graded with a estimated time for completion. This time includes consultation with the group as required, as well as research time and writing time. At the end of each week an excel document will be uploaded with actual time spent by each person, and what tasks they worked on.
So far in our project each individual has met the time requirements or came close to meeting the time requirements for week 3 (outside class and lecture viewing time), this includes our group collaborative working time outside of class for some members. 
Weeks 1 and 2 were spent forming the group and deciding on an project idea, this time was not tracked, but it was minimal.

Beyond Current Capabilities (Patrick)
My current knowledge stems from the unit User-Centred Design, I have had minimal experience with developing a class guided concept from inception to very basic prototype. This project will extend my knowledge because we plan to take the prototype further by coding the app for android. This will also be a challenge because our concept is unguided and we will need to figure out each step of the process on our own, and make our own mistakes and triumphs. This project is also a lot more complex than previous projects of a similar nature i have been a part of.
Brendan: My current capabilities is a basic knowledge of catering for user experience and UI design from  studying UCD, very basic programming and web design skills, and Introduction to IT provided me with some experience working in a team on an IT project. As this kind of project is still relatively new to me, and will require some programming and UI/UX design, every step will help further my current knowledge for this project, improving my ability to program, UI and UX design, and in communication and leadership skills.

Project Risks
Data collation, if we don’t ‘scrub’ the user responses correctly, we could risk building an app that doesn’t serve the purpose it was created for.
 - We will monitor this by ensuring cross checking our individuals opinions on the data across the group, to come to the most likely to be accurate consenus we can.
Taking on too much at once. We need to be careful of not overloading the app with too many features.
 - We have decided already to stick to 3-5 main features, and grow our extended features list. If we complete our initial design we can do further using testing to determine the usability of further features.
Project Timeframe, it is a significant risk that we won’t be able to complete the project within the given timeframe.
 - With great communication and leadership we will do the best we can to complete as much as we can in the given timeframe. Our weekly meetings and standups within the team will give us a good tracking indicator.

Team-Dynamic Challenges
A lack of previous coding experience and wanting to code the entire app could cause significant delays for us.
 - Pre select a couple of coders for the project, and allocate x-hours each week for them to focus on learning the craft.
Collecting enough meaningful user data and quickly. The longer it takes to collect this data, the longer it will take us to begin building the prototype.
 - Get our user survey organised as quickly as possible (it is in draft as of 5/8/2018) and get it out into the world to start collecting data, through a number of mediums.
Keeping everybody on the same page in terms of design decisions. There will be a lot of design to be done by everyone, and we need to ensure everybody has the same goals in mind, or we could waste time building components of the app that don’t work together, or are designed in a different way.
 - Our weekly catch ups and standups will be a perfect way to combat this issue. We also develop an agenda and minutes, which can be referred to at any point to clear up confusion.
