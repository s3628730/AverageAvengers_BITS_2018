Personal background: I was born and raised in Melbourne, Australia, and have lived in Melbourne my whole life. I speak fluent English, and I obtained certificate 5(Advanced) in Korean language from Sejong University, Korea. I am also a registered gemologist and my hobbies include playing games, learning new skills, watching movies and listening to music. I am currently a first year Bachelor of IT student at RMIT University.
My passion in IT mostly lies in programming, specifically games programming, and since coming to study at RMIT I have found an interest in web programming also.
My strong points would be communication, and I have a bit of experience with design and graphic design.
Challenges: Not having any real experience in the IT industry, most of this project will be a challenge. Particularly learning how to code an application such as this. Also working with a  group of people you do not know is always a challenge at first.
I see myself contributing to all facets of this project, as either it being something im confident with, or something I’m interested in learning or improving on. Specifically the coding of the application, UI and UX design.

My background: Originally I am from Hobart, Tasmania and I moved to Melbourne in 2014. I come from a commercial fishing family that specialized in Abalone and Crayfish, which outside of school took up most of my time and allowed me to have some wonderful experiences I will never forget.
My passion: My interest in Information Technology lies mainly in the field of software engineering, I am excited about the future possibilities of artificial intelligence and I am eager to take a path through university that will lead me to hopefully one day working in this area.
My strong points and interests: My strong points from a soft skills perspective lie in project management, leadership, organisation and communication. I have developed these over the last few years as a team leader in a professional services firm. I am interested in furthering developing my technical abilities across the board, with a focus on programming. 
My challenges: The biggest challenges for me in this project is being a team leader in an environment im not used to, and adjusting to the range of different personalities in our group, to bring the best team outcome possible. The biggest challenge I am setting myself this semester is taking a part in the coding of the application itself, this is something I have no knowledge of currently and I intend to push my limits to achieve the goal of completing this project.
My contribution: I will contribute my leadership and administration abilities to ensure a high standard of communication through the use of meeting agendas, minutes, action items and keeping in touch with all group members personally to help manage expectations and workflow. I will contribute my skills in UI/UX to help get us to a working prototype stage. I will also contribute programming skills to help provide the finished product at the end.

I have little background in IT only studying it in year 9 as an elective, learning a lot about HTML and creating simple websites. I chose to study the Bachelor of Information Technology as it seemed interesting and the way of the future I wish to stay in the know of  IT development and what better way than to go into the field.
 Having studied User Centred Design last semester, I am educated in the correct layout of applications for enhanced user Experiences. My Interests in IT lay around web programming and design having studied it previously, it allows creativity and is something new for each site you create.
 Some challenges I face for our project “(app name)” are possible programming failures as I have limited programming experience. Another challenges I may face are keeping up to date on work as it was a challenge last semester and my inspiration for joining this group to create an app to help organise uni life.
 The specific tack I see myself contributing to in the team is the App design and user centred design I hope to contribute to the different abilities of the app and making is run smoothly.
