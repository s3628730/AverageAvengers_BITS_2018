Personal background: I was born and raised in Melbourne, Australia, and have lived in Melbourne my whole life. I speak fluent English, and I obtained certificate 5(Advanced) in Korean language from Sejong University, Korea. I am also a registered gemologist and my hobbies include playing games, learning new skills, watching movies and listening to music. I am currently a first year Bachelor of IT student at RMIT University.
My passion in IT mostly lies in programming, specifically games programming, and since coming to study at RMIT I have found an interest in web programming also.
My strong points would be communication, and I have a bit of experience with design and graphic design.
Challenges: Not having any real experience in the IT industry, most of this project will be a challenge. Particularly learning how to code an application such as this. Also working with a  group of people you do not know is always a challenge at first.
I see myself contributing to all facets of this project, as either it being something im confident with, or something I’m interested in learning or improving on. Specifically the coding of the application, UI and UX design.
